      <h1>How Did I Even Get Here?</h1>
      <p>As an only child to one tough-momma, I finally figured out what I want to be at the age of, *drum roll please*, 27!
      <h2>A Little Backstory...</h2>
      <p>After graduating highschool, which is a totally different story,
         I searched to find out exactly what I really wanted to be.<br>
        
         It began with thinking I wanted to be a pilot, to a nurse, or a social worker...<br>

         <p>It was all quite confusing, I must admit! Yet, it all got boiled down to...</p>
        
      <div>
         <ul>

             <li>Go to work at a dead end job...
               <li>Play it all by ear!</li>
             </p>
      </div>
         <div> Well, neither of that worked out, instead the unexpected happened!</div>
