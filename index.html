      <h1>Who is Victoria RJ?</h1>
    <p>I am an only child to one <u>strong</u> woman and the mother to one very observative little boy!
      <h2>The Journey to Becoming a Newbie Tech-Lover</h2>
      <p>After graduating highschool, I searched to find out exactly who and what I really wanted to be.<br></p>
        
    <p>It began with thinking that I wanted to be a pilot, or a nurse, or a maybe social worker...?<br></p>

         <p>It was all quite a journey, I must admit! <br>However, things got serious once I became a mom! <br> My brain kicked into over drive and suddenly time began to  move really fast. <br> Here is where I concluded a few options...</br></p>
        
      <div>
         <ul class="list">
           <li><p>Work at any job I can get <u>BUT</u> fulfilling someone else's dream</p>
             
           <li><p>Be a stay at home mom (not easy for a strong minded woman..!)</p>
               <p> OR </p>
           <li><u>Face my internal fears and dream bigger than self</u></li>
           
      </div>
         <div> I chose to stare my fears directly into the eyes and leap into the cyber world because I know that I will be one of the greats, I know that technology is leading and most of all, I know that my son is watching!
